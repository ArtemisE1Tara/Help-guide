- You have :50000 at the end of your link
- Your pc and your quest are on the same Wifi
- Your ip hasn't changed, as it changes from time to time

# songs 
- Songs will stay between versions (click restore playlists when changing versions)
- If you try and play a song and the play button is grey you may need some mods to play it, look in the top right on that song for a **blue question mark**. This will show you what mods are needed to play this song read: [(Grey play buton)](/mod_setup_and_troubleshooting/grey_play_button.md)



# To add songs to your game you can use a few different methods

## The in game song downloader
This is the simplest method of adding songs to your game, you can open this by looking to your left in the main menu and clicking "song downloader" will bring you into a menu that looks like this:

At the top of this page you can see a search bar, you can type the name of the song you want to download there. You can also add filters to this list to show only songs that use noodle extensions, or filter only ranked songs.

## The bmbf web interface.

You can get songs and playlists from a few places.
- [(Beastsaber)](https://bsaber.com/)  This is better for playlists and songs of quality.
- [(Beatsaver)](https://beatsaver.com/) This has litteraly every song uploaded but thats both a good and bad thing.
- [(Beatsage)](https://beatsage.com/) This is a webiste you can use to auto generate songs, these songs are often not the best quality. 

### To add these songs or playlists you can drag the files into the bmbf web interface shown below, for playlists you can use `.bplist` or `.json` files, for songs you can use `.zip` files.

### More on beatsage
- Beat Sage is an AI map generator that will create "good enough" maps when given a music file or song link. 
- In terms of the quality, it's basically the McDonald's of mapping. While generally "playable" in an academic sense and has its uses, they don't offer much in terms of actual fun factor/feeling/soul of the map. 
- Beat sage should be used as a last resort if the song you want to play exists nowhere else.

## Downloading inside bmbf
- To download songs you can open [(Beastsaber)](https://bsaber.com/) or [(Beatsaver)](https://beatsaver.com/) Inside the browser tab of bmbf
