- Replay will crash qosmetics if you have custom trails enabled 
- Check to see if it is still crashing with no other mods installed, if it is uninstall and reinstall the mod
- Make sure you are on the latest version of qosmetics, you can get it [(here)](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/Qosmetics/releases/download/v1.3.2/Qosmetics.qmod)
- If it is still crashing after all of these open sidequest or any file explorer and go to `Sdcard/moddata/com.beatgames.beatsaber/mods/qosmetics/configs` and delete everything in this folder. 
- If it is still crashing after this try removing all *models* installed.
