If BeatLeader is crashing when hitting the play button OR not doing anything when you try to log in:
Try restarting your game first. If that doesn’t work, using a file browser like SideQuest’s, go to `sdcard/ModData/com.beatgames.beatsaber/Mods/bl/cookies` and delete `cookies.txt`. This should fix everything.
