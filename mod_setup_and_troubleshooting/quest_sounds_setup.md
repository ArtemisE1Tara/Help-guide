### how to setup quest sounds
 - Run the game once with the mod enabled.
 - After that, navigate to the `sdcard/ModData/com.beatgames.beatsaber/Mods/QuestSounds` folder via Sidequest. 
 - Simply put your sound in the right folder 
 - Select it in-game via the QuestSounds mod settings (Beat Saber Main Menu -> Settings -> Mod Settings)

Currently `.ogg`, `.mp3`, `.aif`, `.aiff`, `.mp2` and `.wav` files are supported and only files ending in those will work as sounds.



*Note, quest sounds will cause a crash on 1.21 if installed with beat together and multiplayer core.*
