### To add custom sabers, walls and blocks to beatsaber you need a mod called qosmetics.
- To get custom model files you can download them from the [(Qosmetics discord)](https://discord.gg/qosmetics)
- once you are in the qosmetics discord you need to get the model archive role from [(#rules-and-info)](https://discord.com/channels/691791384922816594/730840196211277975)
- Then in the server go to the finished models Category and download any models you want.

- after getting the models if they are a .qsaber, .qwall or .qbloq then you can drag them into the bmbf web interface shown below.
